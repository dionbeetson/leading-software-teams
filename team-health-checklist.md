# Engineering team health checklist
Questions to ask your team leads or engineering manager to assist in determining if their team is operating effectively. It also is an opportunity for you to provide guidance and support in uplifting in relevant areas as you identify areas of improvement.

## How healthy is the teams technical uplift capacity?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: When technical uplift capacity isn't managed well, platforms are more expensive to maintain and delivery of new features is slower.
  - For a team: Team members become frustrated about working on inefficient platforms, can become stressed, which can result in retention challenges.
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - What technical uplift is being prioritised for the next 6 months and why?
 - Supporting as a manager:
  - Where can I support you in ensuring a healthy level of technical uplift capacity in the team?

## What level of BAU capacity is required to keeps the lights on?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: Realistic known BAU capacity shows the true cost of maintaining a platform and thus what left over capacity is available for new features.
  - For a team: Clarity on how much time is required for BAU within a team allows the team to better commit to realistic timeframes for feature development without overcommitting.
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - How much capacity are we spending on BAU? Is it enough? Not enough?
  - What changes do we need to implement to improve/reduce BAU required for this platform?
  - How well does the organisation/team know the amount of BAU capacity being spent supporting the platform?
- Support as a manager:
  - Where can I support you in ensuring BAU capacity is adequately carved out within the team?
  - Where can I support you in prioritising projects to reduce ongoing BAU within the team?

## What is your teams purpose?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: Organisations will struggle to retain talent in teams without a purpose.
  - For a team: Teams without a purpose won't be as self-motivated within their day to day.
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - What is your teams purpose?
  - What next steps do you need to invest in to define a team purpose?
 - Supporting as a manager:
  - What clarity can I provide to help you work with your teams to define a purpose?
  - Can I help you with approaches to define a team purpose?

## How is the team tackling ad-hoc requests?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: If an organisation knows how to approach ad-hoc work requests into engineering teams it will reduce friction and frustration between teams.
  - For a team: Teams with a process to tackle reactive work loads will be better able to protect their focus on key projects.
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - What processes do we need to put in place to better manage ad-hoc requests?
  - How much capacity should be dedicated to ad-hoc requests?
  - Where are the majority of ad-hoc requests coming from?
 - Supporting as a manager:
  - Can I share with you techniques around managing ad-hoc requests? Eg: Firefighter role in team.

## How many weeks of work are prioritised within the backlog for the team?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: Understanding which teams have too much in the prioritised backlog, or too little can make visible bottlenecks or spare capacity for better future planning.
  - For a team: Teams with a healthy and mostly prioritised backlog of upcoming work is motivating for individuals
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - What can we do to ensure at least 4 weeks of backlog work defined?
  - What is causing too little being prioritised in the backlog?
  - Why is the team struggling with prioritising a backlog effectively?
 - Supporting as a manager:
  - Where can I provide clarity on direction to assist in prioritising the teams backlog?

## How much experimentation is the team doing?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: An organisation with a culture of experimentation will encourage new ideas to be explored with less resistance that drives innovation.
  - For a team: A team with time to experiment fuels creativity and engagement. It allows a team to innovate in architecture, new ideas and process improvements.
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - What experiments have been done in the last 3 months?
  - What experiments are scheduled in the next 3 months?
  - What can we do to carve out time for more experimentation?
 - Supporting as a manager:
  - Where can I help to carve out a healthy amount of experimentation time for the team?

## What engineering practices are the team focusing on improving?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: Organisations that focus on promoting a culture of continuous improvement, will continuously improve slow and ineffective processes that are slowing them down.
  - For a team: A team that continually improves their engineering practices, will continually become more effective, avoid stagnation, and improve the level of trust between themselves
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - Where is the team struggling on improving?
  - What engineering practices are the team focusing on improving currently?
 - Supporting as a manager:
  - Where can I support you in
  - These are the engineering practices I believe you should be investing time looking into improving within the team [include_examples].

## What are teams doing to improve their collaboration in the remote working world?
 - Why it's important?
  - For an organisation: Organisations need to ensure their teams have access to the right tools and management style to be effective working entirely remotely.
  - For a team: It is important for teams to feel a sense of belonging while engaging entirely in the virtual world.
 - Deep dive question(s):
  - What is your team finding challenging with working remotely?
  - What practices has your team implemented for working remotely more effectively?
  - What practices are your teams evolving to work entirely remotely?
 - Supporting as a manager:
  - Where can I support you in enabling your team to work better remotely?
